Choose your own space to be in. To form your surroundings in a way that will make you take the best out of you. Free is to say NO. It is to be able to choose your limits, to stretch them to a place only you can create, and change them when you feel they no longer fit you. Free is to say what ever you want, to whomever you want, and however you want. Free is to know you have a different option. Do you know you have a different option? Linux! Get your freedom.</blockquote>Đây là đoạn clip giành chiến thắng trong cuộc thi video clip mang chủ đề <span style="font-style: italic;">We're Linux</span> do <a href="http://video.linuxfoundation.org/category/video-category/-linux-foundation-video-contest">Linux Foundation</a> tổ chức.<br />Để xem tất cả các clip thì click <a href="http://video.linuxfoundation.org/category/video-category/-linux-foundation-video-contest">vào đây</a>.</div>
