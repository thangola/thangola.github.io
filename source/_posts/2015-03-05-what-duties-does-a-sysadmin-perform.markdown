Duties can be quite site-specific.  Typical things that a sysadmin does,
in the quest to keep things running smoothly, include:

   *  ensuring backups are being made timely and correctly
   *  closing security holes 
   *  watching the system logs for problems
   *  keeping the software up-to-date
   *  keeping current with his knowledge of the software
   *  writing small programs and scripts
   *  maintaining the network hardware and software
   *  keeping track of resource usage (so you don't run out of disk space,
        ram, cpu cycles, or network bandwidth at a crucial moment)
   *  evaluating and recommending hardware and software
   *  doing field repairs on equipment (replacing disks, boards, etc.)
   *  routine maintenance (cleaning tape drives, replacing toner cartridges)
   *  pull wire for new workstations
   *  account creation and deletion
   *  user training
   * writing documentation
   * answering user questions
